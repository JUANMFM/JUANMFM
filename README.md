## Hi, I'm JUANMFMðŸ‘‹
With a background in Economic Engineering from the National University of Engineering and experience in technological projects related to Big Data, I believe that I have the necessary skills and motivation to effectively contribute to your development team.

Throughout my professional career, I have acquired knowledge and skills in various areas of technology. I have worked on architecture design, data ingestion, and configuration of connections to databases such as Teradata, Oracle, and Informix. In addition, I have experience in implementing and monitoring Hadoop environments and migrating systems to cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. During my time on these projects, I have developed a good command of SQL and have worked with programming languages â€‹â€‹such as C++, R, Python, and Spark, as well as data visualization tools such as Power BI and Looker Studio.
